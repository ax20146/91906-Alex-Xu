Daniel Yu:
- Make cursor change when selecting levels
- You should make it possible to click off when clicking again
- Make splash damage much bigger
- Bit hard to tell when the machine gun is hitting enemy
- Maybe add sound

Syzmon:

Anthony:
- Hard mode is too hard
- You need instructions
- Instructions need to be displayed throughout the game, no-one would know to wait in the start menu
-

Ray:
- Hover effect for menu
- Good game
- The end screen was weird
