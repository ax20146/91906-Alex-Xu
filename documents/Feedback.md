| 21/03 | Ethan        | - Somehow make the tower placements more accessible.<br>- Have option with tower's targets.<br>- Overall good and simple design. | - Added hints on screen to explain user to select slots, 1st hint is made to always be 'select slots to place towers'.<br>- Now tower all target 1st instead of the previous closest. |
| 21/03 | Christian    | - No instruction which makes the game very unclear.                                                                              | - Added hints on menu (Made 1st hint) to always be 'select slots ...'.                                                                                                                |
| 21/03 | Jason        | - Make coin collection have magnetic effect.<br>- Make the coins spawn in a large area.<br>- Randomness with coin drops.         | - The coins are random within a tile of 64x64 range around the spot the enemy dies.<br>- Added coin attraction to cursor.                                                             |

Daniel Yu:

-   Make cursor change when selecting levels
-   You should make it possible to click off when clicking again
-   Make splash damage much bigger
-   Bit hard to tell when the machine gun is hitting enemy
-   Maybe add sound

Anthony:

-   Hard mode is too hard
-   You need instructions
-   Instructions need to be displayed throughout the game, no-one would know to wait in the start menu
-

Ray:

-   Hover effect for menu
-   Good game
-   The end screen was weird
